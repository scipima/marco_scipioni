# Bio

I am a project officer at the European Commission.
I have a BA and MA in Philosophy and Ethics, an MSc and PhD in Politics, and am about to complete a Graduate Certificate track as Data Scientist.
Currently, I mainly work on migration, public opinion, and elections.


## Projects

[Atlas of Demography](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/atlas-demography_en#more_information_and_links). A new knowledge management tool to better understand demographic change. 

[Dynamic Data Hub](https://migration-demography-tools.jrc.ec.europa.eu/data-hub/). Explore and analyse datasets relevant to migration and demography.

[Data for Integration of migrants (D4I)](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/dataset/ds00164_en). The Data for Integration (D4I) dataset has been obtained through a spatial disaggregation of statistics of the 2011 Census, collected from National Statistical Institutes.
The results of the spatial processing of the original data is a uniform grid showing the concentration of migrants in cells of 100 by 100 m in all cities of eight European countries (France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and the United Kingdom).
